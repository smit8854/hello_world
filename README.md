# hello, world!

My name is Michael Smith and I am a 1st year PhD student at the University of Minnesota in the Department of Speech-Language-Hearing Sciences! My research interests are speech perception in cochlear implant listeners, auditory training, phonetics, and a whole lot more. When I need a break from academia, I enjoy playing D&D and videogames with my friends, cooking, and traveling. I expect to do a lot of the latter once COVID is over!
